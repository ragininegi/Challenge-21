# ERC-20 Token and Crowdsale

ERC-20 compatible fungible token created with the help of a "Crowdsale" contract from the OpenZeppelin Solidity library.

Users can transfer ether to the crowdsale contract in order to receive KAI, or KaseiCoin tokens, and the crowdsale contract administers the entire crowdsale process. The tokens will be immediately created by your contract and distributed to buyers in a single transaction.

## Technology 

* [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/) - to run Solidity code and deploy contracts
* [Ganache](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache) - to run transactions on local Blockchain 
* [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) - as a wallet to link the contract to the local blockchain

## Usage

Remix IDE will compile and deploy.sol files after you upload them.

Use a local test account to deploy the deployer contract.

Using the At Address method and the contract addresses generated by the deployer contract, crowdsale and token contracts should be deployed.
